"Data Analytics: Diversity, Distribution and Dynamics",2022,"The nature of data analytics is changing so fast that many businesses struggle to understand what tools and approaches they should consider.

Companies that fall behind are either failing to act or are focusing on the wrong issues. As a result, they are getting outdone by competitors, often digital natives, who understand how to make the most of modern methods.

Companies that succeed are doing so based on insights, agility, and the efficiency and the decision-making power that come from working with data they know they can trust.



Businesses that still rely on and try to manage the three Vs of big data — variety, velocity, and volume — operate from an outdated basis. What matters most now are the three Ds of data in the cloud: diversity, distribution, and dynamics.

The three Ds concern the different challenges of data, where that data comes from, and how to manage information that is changing moment to moment.


Other critical factors for achieving a modern data environment include treating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as real concepts, not just theoretical ideas; and enabling data to go from anywhere to anywhere — for example, from ML models or cloud data platforms back into operational systems in a more enriched state — rather than following a linear path from source to analysis to dashboard.

Diverse organizations must grapple with the fact that data now comes in a wider variety of forms, including transactional records, research and development results, inventory reports, financial statements, customer care interactions, marketing efforts, social media, machine logs, and much more.

As mentioned above, we also have to focus on the influence of artificial intelligence on the modern data environment.

AI has always been a bit of an ethical quagmire. What exactly should AI be allowed to learn? Who gets to decide? Once it’s been activated, is anybody allowed to deactivate it? While AI is of course a part of the tech space, the difficulty some firms are facing is just how human, or superhuman, they really want to make AI. Equip an AI with enough learning capability, and who’s to say it won’t eventually become the dominant form of life on earth. Some scientists think that’s a distinct possibility. 

To counteract the slight existential angst that AI inevitably causes, Google says it’s developed a ‘big red button’ that could shut down any AI if necessary. But with several scientists warning that some AI could already be semi-conscious, who’s really to say that the computers haven’t already worked out a way around it. Makes you think, right? 

After I have scared you about AI and excessive ML, let’s go back to the main topic of data management and understand how important the three Ds of data are. The three Ds concern the different challenges of data, where that data comes from, and how to manage information that is changing moment to moment.

Data scientist: Robredo mananalo,2022,"MANILA, Philippines — Idineklara ng data scientist na si Roger Do na mananalo si Vice President Leni Robredo kay Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. sa karera sa pagkapangulo.

“I am projecting the winner in the 2022 Philippines presidential election to be Leni Robredo by at least 4 percent of the total votes,” wika ni Do sa isang blog na naka-post sa Auto Politic.

Ibinatay ni Do ang kanyang prediksyon sa social intelligence tracking na kanyang ginawa kasama ang ADDS Sentiment Analysis sa nakalipas na limang buwan.



Batay sa bagong datos mula sa ADDS Sentiment, sinabi ni Do na nakakuha si Robredo ng pinakamataas na engagement score na 7.46 milyon mula Abril 21 hanggang Mayo 4, o 22-porsiyentong pagtaas. Malayo naman si Marcos na may 4.69 million.

Matapos pumangalawa kay Marcos noong Pebrero, humataw si Robredo noong Marso kung saan nakakuha siya ng 8 milyong engagement kumpara 7.5 milyon ng katunggali.


Maliban sa prediksiyon ni Do, nakikita rin ng Google Trends ang panalo ni Robredo sa darating na halalan sa Mayo 9 matapos mapanatili ang lamang kay Bongbong.

Ilang araw bago ang halalan, angat pa rin si Robredo sa Google Trends na may 55 porsiyento kumpara sa 24 porsiyento ni Marcos."
More business opportunities for Philippines,2022,"Another opportunity has presented itself for the country.

The Philippines is now considered one of the prime emerging data center markets in Southeast Asia and currently ranks second in the region in terms of data center growth, according to a report from property consulting firm Colliers.

Colliers revealed that a number of local and international data center operators have already pledged their investments or expressed or interest in locating in the Philippines. These include Singapore-based SpaceDC, which is investing P36.4 billion for its 72-megawatt hyperscale data center in Cainta, and Converge ICT Solutions, which is constructing its P1-billion data center in Cebu to meet increasing digital services and transactions in the Visayas and Mindanao regions.



It said upcoming data centers in the country include those of Alibaba Cloud in Manila, YCO Cloud Centers in Batangas, Dito Telecommunity in Pampanga and ePLDT Vitro in Sta. Rosa. Meanwhile, US-based data center developers Endecgroup Inc. and Black and Veatch are said to be keen on expanding in the Philippines.

Arizton Advisory and Intelligence expects the Philippine data center market to attract $635 million worth of investments by 2027 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.4 percent compared to the $298 million in 2021.


Colliers director and head of capital markets and investment services Paul Chua said the country is one of the largest early adopters of digital technology, be it for social media, e-commerce, education or financial services and with the large tracts of data needed to effectively optimize the exchange of information, the Philippines is now being touted as the next viable destination for data center operations.

These facilities, which are used by enterprises to digitally house their critical business applications and information, should be sustained by the continued rise of e-commerce transactions, emergence of smart cities, proliferation of cloud computing technologies, need for 5G connectivity, increasing financial inclusion, and the government’s push to digitize its processes, the report noted.

Colliers explained that business transformation in the last two years has pushed organizations to embrace digitization, boosting demand for data centers globally. Data from Arizton, an advisory and intelligence firm, showed that global data center investment market size reached $215.8 billion or P11.2 trillion in 2021, and is expected to reach $288.3 billion or P15.5 trillion in 2027.

The report revealed that most data centers in the Philippines are owned by telecommunication companies including ePLDT and Globe but recently, more local and international players have invested in the domestic data center market including Converge, Dito Telecommunity, Beeinfotech, Alibaba, YCO Cloud Centers and SpaceDC.

It noted that cloud computing and storage are among the primary global drivers of data center development and due to increasing remote work in the last two years, companies have started migrating their data and critical information to the cloud.

Data analytics company GlobalData projects that enterprise spending on cloud services of local enterprises will grow from P93.6 billion in 2020 to P135.2 billion in 2024. Colliers said this would likely sustain the demand for more data centers in the country.

Among the cloud computing companies planning to set up operations in the Philippines are Alibaba Cloud in Manila and YCO Cloud Centers in Batangas.

For its part, Colliers believes that the outsourcing sector should also increase the demand for cloud services as BPO companies continue to implement a hybrid work model and subscribe to the cloud computing model.

Among the top industries expected to drive demand for data centers in the country are telecom, cloud computing, e-commerce, banking and finance, hospitals, and government, which is pushing to automate processes.

Meanwhile, it said that the uptick in e-commerce utilization has also raised interest in data center operations. In fact, in 2021, data from Google, Temasek and Bain & Co. showed that the country’s e-commerce gross merchandise value grew by 24 percent year on year, this being the highest growth among major Southeast Asian economies during the period.

It is estimated that e-commerce transactions in the country will grow to P495.2 billion by 2025 from P270 billion in 2021 while another report projects e-commerce sales to reach P624 billion in 2025 from P187.2 billion in 2020. For its part, the Department of Trade and Industry expects the number of domestic online business to increase from 500,000 in 2020 to one million this year. The surge of data from online shopping and e-payment systems, Colliers said, is provoking the need for more data centers and the massive usage of social media should also support growth of data demand in the country.

New frontiers
A Filipino-owned holding company is changing the face of Guiguinto, Bulacan, and the lives of its residents as well.

Czark Mak Corp. started in the town with the development in 2017 of T12 Polo Industrial Estates, a 15-hectare property that houses warehousing facilities mostly for fast-moving consumer goods, with leasable space of 56,000 square meters.

Now, it is developing Acro City, a 10-hectare property within T12, which is now the site of a three-story boutique hotel called Acrocity Residences.

Just last week, Acrocity Residences was unveiled to the public, coinciding with the opening of Café de Margaux Bistro on the ground floor attended by a number of VIPs including Sen. JV Ejercito, Guiguinto Mayor Agatha Cruz, Bulacan 5th district Rep. Ambrosio Cruz, Baliuag Mayor Ferdie Estrella and Malolos Vice Mayor Miguel Tengco-Bautista.

Acrocity is also the home of Mt. Fuji Japanese Restaurant and will soon have a Chinese restaurant within the year.

Czark Mak chairman and president Caesar Wongchuking revealed that the group is now looking into expanding their business by developing a mid-rise residential building within Acrocity.

He explained that Acrocity Residences’ development was brought about by the need for more world-class hotels in the area. It is the biggest hotel in Guiguinto, with 102 rooms.

The growth of Guiguinto town is inevitable, especially with huge infrastructure projects like Northrail, which will pass through the nearby town of Malolos, underway. San Miguel Corp.’s ongoing international airport development is also only 10 minutes away, not to mention SMC’s MRT-7 project which will have its last station in San Jose, Del Monte, Bulacan.

Czark Mak also owns Polaris Industrial Estates in Baliuag, Bulacan, Sapporo Ice and Cold Storage and Acro Ice which has facilities in Cavite, Bacolod, Bulacan and Batangas, Nordic Atlantic Logistics Group, to name a few."
"Philippines records 1,326 new COVID cases, 56 deaths",2022,"MANILA — The Philippines on Tuesday recorded 1,326 new COVID-19 cases, raising the number of active infections to 23,272 and the national total caseload so far to 3,894,840.

This is the lowest daily tally in 2 months, or since July 6, 2022, according to ABS-CBN Data Analytics head Edson Guido.

Of Tuesday's numbers, 498 were from Metro Manila.


Health department data also showed that 56 more patients succumbed to the respiratory disease, the highest since May 1. 

This raised the total fatalities to 62,118.

On the other hand, the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in the Philippines has reached 3,809,450.

The DOH also reported that the nation's positivity rate — or the percentage of people who test positive for the coronavirus among all those who have gotten the test — from September 4 to 5 is down at 10.9 percent.

At least 72.6 million people in the country have been fully vaccinated against the respiratory disease, of whom 18.1 million have received their booster shots.

A special vaccination campaign against COVID-19 will be done Sept. 26-30, with the government aiming to administer at least 5 million booster shots, the Department of Health earlier said."
What will the internet of the future look like?,2022,"Are we on the cusp of yet another internet revolution? We are, according to technology experts gathered in Berlin for a conference organized by digital learning platform ada.

New technology could overhaul the web as we know it in the coming decade, they said — both when it comes to how it is built and how it looks.

On a technical level, tech idealists hope that blockchain technology will help build a new decentralized architecture underlying the internet. In this new ""web3"" era, the idea goes, users rather than a handful of tech giants would have control over their data, privacy, and what they create online.


""This reinvents how the internet is set up in the backend,"" Portugal-based author Shermin Voshmgir said. ""It is a complete paradigm shift.""

At the same time, companies around the world are working on technology to revolutionize the way we navigate the web.

Their vision: Rather than scrolling through websites or apps, people will soon stroll virtually through a three-dimensional version of the internet dubbed the ""metaverse"" — a digital landscape of sorts where users can work, buy things or meet their friends, and where physical and digital realities converge.

""It will be a walk-in internet, so to speak,"" said Constanze Osei, who leads the society and innovation policy efforts for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at US tech giant Meta, formerly known as Facebook.

But as companies like hers pour billions into developing that next generation of the internet, digital rights activists caution that the firms will eventually want to cash in on their investment — and that this could thwart efforts to give users more power over their digital selves.

""The metaverse could become the most invasive surveillance system ever created,"" said Micaela Mantegna, an Argentinian lawyer and digital rights researcher.


The evolution of the internet 

To understand where the next generation of the internet could go wrong, it helps to look at how we got here.

As early as the 1960s, researchers began connecting computers around the world. But it wasn't until the 1990s that the invention of the world-wide-web and web browsers made the network available to anyone who was able to afford an internet connection.

Since then, the web has upended every aspect of society, from the way people do business to how they find information or interact with each other.

""Everything has changed because of the internet,"" said Miriam Meckel, CEO of ada and professor of corporate communications at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. ""And the internet itself has changed, as well.""

During the web's first phase, people browsed the web from their desktop computers and navigated it mainly via search engines. That changed in the 2000s with the emergence of social media and mobile internet, giving rise to the online world as we know it today.


At the core of this ""web2,"" there are online platforms such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram or, more recently, messaging services like Telegram.

Those platforms have helped dissidents in authoritarian regimes organize protests or give marginalized groups a voice. But revelations such as the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal have shown that they are also used to spread hate, amplify disinformation and sway democratic elections.

Meanwhile, a small number of Big Tech companies like Meta or Google's parent company Alphabet have come to dominate their respective segments of the internet economy.

More power to the users
 
To shift power back to individuals and communities, people like author Shermin Voshmgir have proposed rebuilding the web with decentralized public blockchains — databases that are searchable by everyone and shared on computers around the world.

Such a ""web3"" would be collectively controlled by users rather than a few powerful gatekeepers, the idea goes — making it easier, for example, for creatives to make money with the work they publish online.

Now, the multi-billion question is: Will this plan succeed?


Not everyone is convinced: Jürgen Geuter, a Berlin-based internet theorist known online under the pseudonym ""tante,"" doubts that a decentralized architecture alone is enough to shift power back to users. He pointed to cryptocurrencies, a field where already today, a few companies are making millions by developing the software necessary to access the underlying decentralized network.

""Technology is never neutral,"" Geuter said.

Web3 versus the Metaverse? 

To prevent the metaverse from being controlled by just a few influential players, experts say users should be able to interact with each other no matter where in the metaverse they are or how they're using it. That would also be a change from today’s web, where apps are mostly ""walled gardens"" that do not allow users to send messages or money between different apps, for instance.

""There is an understanding that things need to change from web2,"" acknowledged Meta's Constanze Osei. She pointed to a new initiative announced in June, with which her company, along with other tech giants and standards-setting bodies, want to discuss interoperability standards. But some big players such as US tech giant Apple are notably absent from the effort.

At the same time, there is a certain irony in the fact that the world's largest tech giants say they want to invest in building a new internet architecture that could, eventually, curb their market power.


And some observers warn that once the companies will try to capitalize on that investment, some of the ideals of a decentralized web3 architecture could end up as collateral damage.

""The corporate version of the metaverse will be an evolution of capitalism,"" Argentinian lawyer Micaela Mantegna said.

What's more, she added, the immersive nature of the metaverse could exacerbate some of the problems that plague today's web2, from disinformation to online harassment. Some users have already reported being sexually harassed in early versions of the metaverse.

And Mantegna warned that, as technology evolves, the devices used to access the metaverse could at some point begin monitoring sensitive information like the brain activity of users.

To protect such data and prevent surveillance on an unprecedented scale, governments and regulators must come up with rules for the age of the metaverse, she said.

First efforts are underway: Earlier this week, the European Union announced a global regulation initiative for next year.

But Mantegna said that governments needed to hurry up to avoid the mistakes of today's internet — a web that, as she put it, ""was designed with good intentions but bad implementation.""

""We don't want the metaverse to become the bad sequel of the internet,"" she said.

Start-up sends tiny robots on voyage into brains,2022,"LOS ANGELES - Sending miniature robots deep inside the human skull to treat brain disorders has long been the stuff of science fiction -- but it could soon become reality, according to a California start-up.

Bionaut Labs plans its first clinical trials on humans in just two years for its tiny injectable robots, which can be carefully guided through the brain using magnets.

Could injectable microrobots one day run in your veins?
""The idea of the micro robot came about way before I was born,"" said co-founder and CEO Michael Shpigelmacher.


""One of the most famous examples is a book by Isaac Asimov and a film called 'Fantastic Voyage,' where a crew of scientists goes inside a miniaturized spaceship into the brain, to treat a blood clot.""

Just as cellphones now contain extremely powerful components that are smaller than a grain of rice, the tech behind micro-robots ""that used to be science fiction in the 1950s and 60s"" is now ""science fact,"" said Shpigelmacher. 

""We want to take that old idea and turn it into reality,"" the 43-year-old scientist told AFP during a tour of his company's Los Angeles research and development center.

Working with Germany's prestigious Max Planck research institutes, Bionaut Labs settled on using magnetic energy to propel the robots -- rather than optical or ultrasonic techniques -- because it does not harm the human body.

Magnetic coils placed outside the patient's skull are linked up to a computer that can remotely and delicately maneuver the micro-robot into the affected part of the brain, before removing it via the same route.

The entire apparatus is easily transportable, unlike an MRI, and uses 10 to 100 times less electricity.


'YOU'RE STUCK'

In a simulation watched by AFP, the robot -- a metal cylinder just a few millimeters long, in the shape of a tiny bullet -- slowly follows a pre-programed trajectory through a gel-filled container, which emulates the density of the human brain.

Once it nears a pouch filled with blue liquid, the robot is swiftly propelled like a rocket and pierces the sack with its pointed end, allowing liquid to flow out.

Inventors hope to use the robot to pierce fluid-filled cysts within the brain when clinical trials begin in two years.

If successful, the process could be used to treat Dandy-Walker Syndrome, a rare brain malformation affecting children.

Sufferers of the congenital ailment can experience cysts the size of a golf ball, which swell and increase pressure on the brain, triggering a host of dangerous neurological conditions.


Bionaut Labs has already tested its robots on large animals such as sheep and pigs, and ""the data shows that the technology is safe for us"" human beings, said Shpigelmacher.

If approved, the robots could offer key advantages over existing treatments for brain disorders.

""Today, most brain surgery and brain intervention is limited to straight lines -- if you don't have a straight line to the target, you're stuck, you're not going to get there,"" said Shpigelmacher.

Micro-robotic tech ""allows you to reach targets you were not able to reach, and reaching them repeatedly in the safest trajectory possible,"" he added.

'HEATING UP'

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year granted Bionaut Labs approvals that pave the way for clinical trials to treat Dandy-Walker Syndrome, as well as malignant gliomas -- cancerous brain tumors often considered to be inoperable.


In the latter case, the micro-robots will be used to inject anti-cancer drugs directly into brain tumors in a ""surgical strike.""

Existing treatment methods involve bombarding the whole body with drugs, leading to potential severe side effects and loss of effectiveness, said Shpigelmacher.

The micro-robots can also take measurements and collect tissue samples while inside the brain.

Bionaut Labs -- which has around 30 employees -- has held discussions with partners for the use of its tech to treat other conditions affecting the brain including Parkinson's, epilepsy or strokes.

""To the best of my knowledge, we are the first commercial effort"" to design a product of this type with ""a clear path to the clinic trials,"" said Shpigelmacher.

""But I don't think that we will be the only one... This area is heating up.""

"Help wanted at BIR: Data scientists, cybersecurity experts",2022,"MANILA, Philippines—As it pushes forward with a digital shift to shore up collections, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is looking for data scientists and cybersecurity experts to join the country’s biggest tax agency, Commissioner Lilia Guillermo said on Friday (Aug. 19).

But while the BIR was already providing digital infrastructure to move to electronic services, like e-invoicing, many in the private sector remained resistant to digitalization, as shown by the low number of participants in the ongoing electronic invoicing pilot program, Guillermo said at the first SGV tax symposium.

Guillermo told the forum that “rightsizing” for the BIR meant beefing up its personnel in the forefront of the agency’s digital transformation program.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the BIR in 2019 unveiled its 2030 digital transformation roadmap aimed at making all transactions with clients instantaneous and seamless. Under the roadmap, the BIR plans to provide taxpayers 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week access to services via online systems and mobile applications starting this year.

In an interview, Guillermo said the BIR was looking for fresh graduates who may be interested to become data scientists and cybersecurity experts. The BIR chief said the bureau needed six to eight cybersecurity experts and the same number of data scientists.

However, Guillermo conceded that it may be hard to attract such specialized talents as compensation at the BIR was not at par with those being offered by the private sector. While her BIR predecessors had pushed for exemption from the salary standardization law (SSL), Guillermo said it may be difficult to legislate it at this time.

In the meantime, Guillermo said the BIR recently hired six new statisticians, who can be trained to become data scientists.

Also, Guillermo said the bureau was looking at hiring consultants who would enjoy bigger pay, but likely with no security of tenure as contractual workers.

Digitalization had been identified by Guillermo and Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno as one way for the BIR to catch up with its revenue target of P2.44 trillion for 2022. In the first half of the year, the BIR collected P1.14 trillion in taxes, which was 6.3-percent short of the P1.21-trillion target for the six-month period. The BIR chief said July collections likely hit the P201.5-billion goal for the month.

To run after social media influencers earning huge money and “big-time” online sellers, the BIR planned to tap data analytics to process big data from social media sites, Guillermo said.

She said the BIR temporarily suspended audits on social media influencers and online sellers, but will resume it within the year. She added that the BIR will seek the help of global e-commerce platforms—like Lazada and Shopee —to provide data on online sales while addressing concerns on data privacy.

Leveraging nontraditional data for recovery,2022,"Data is now recognized as “the new oil” for the digital economy. While development actors have relied on traditional data sources, such as public surveys and government administrative data, there is great potential to harness the value of unconventional or nontraditional data from the private sector, which can help fuel a more nimble, agile, and inclusive governance.

Private companies routinely collect, analyze, and use large volumes of data to derive actionable insights and inform business strategies. The ability and pace at which this data is harnessed with the aid of data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence tools has allowed businesses to successfully navigate through several forms of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic. In this dynamic and uncertain environment, the importance of high-frequency, timely, and granular data to inform decision-making has become invaluable.

ADVERTISEMENT

Can we harness the power of data for the public good? Can we bridge the data gap to give governments access to data, insights, and tools that can inform their response and recovery strategies?

There is increasing recognition that traditional and nontraditional data should be seen as complementary. Nontraditional data can bring significant benefits in bridging existing data gaps but must be calibrated against benchmarks based on established traditional data. These traditional datasets are widely seen as reliable being subject to established stringent international and national standards. However, they are often limited in frequency and granularity, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Meanwhile, nontraditional data such as market research routinely collected monthly from nationwide household surveys may only be specific to certain products and brands, but can provide more frequent and granular information, with disaggregation by geographical area, socioeconomic group of households, gender, and other attributes. Data collected from mobile devices, internet platforms, and satellite images are available in real time and offer high granularity in location.

UNDP, with support from The Rockefeller Foundation and the government of Japan, setup the Pintig Lab: a multidisciplinary network of data scientists, economists, epidemiologists, mathematicians, and political scientists, tasked with supporting data-driven crisis response and development strategies. In 2021, the Lab conducted a study on how data on household spending on consumer-packaged goods can been used to assess the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 and identify heterogeneities in the pace of recovery across Philippine households. The National Economic and Development Authority is incorporating this data for GDP forecasting, as additional input to their predictive models for consumption. Further, this data can be combined with credit card or mobile wallet transactions, and machine learning techniques for higher-frequency GDP nowcasting, to allow for nimble and responsive economic policies that can absorb and anticipate the shocks of crisis.


Nontraditional data has the potential to provide insights on the status of vulnerable groups, including the informal sector, which are not fully captured by official statistics. As such, the Department of Information and Communications Technology and UNDP are exploring the use of satellite imagery to identify “last mile” communities and understand their level of connectivity in terms of Wi-Fi, electricity, roads, education, health care, and markets. UNDP has utilized chatbots on social media platforms to rapidly collate information from disadvantaged sectors and small enterprises, to understand how the pandemic has impacted them, and the extent to which the social amelioration programs have worked.

These are powerful examples of how nontraditional data can and has shed light on disadvantaged groups previously invisible, allowing for more inclusive programming so that no one gets left behind.

We have only begun to open the door to a parallel world of nontraditional data that has existed alongside us for decades now. Data is inherently political and maximizing its positive impacts for society will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders to shape the ways in which data is accessed, analyzed, and used beyond the confines of their “for-profit” origins. Doing so could unlock the potential for more rapid and inclusive evidence-based interventions for those who need it the most.

Insular Foundation supports data science training for women,2021,"MANILA, Philippines — The Insular Foundation, in partnership with the For the Women Foundation, recently supported 18 scholars’ venture into data science. With the foundations’ shared advocacy to empower women through education, the training program presents career opportunities in data science and analytics which are considered as the careers of the future.

The 18 scholars, composed of 15 women and three men, completed 10 Saturdays of intensive data science online training from the comforts of their homes in various cities in Metro Manila, Cavite, Nueva Ecija and Benguet. The scholars whose average age was 24, came from diverse backgrounds – new college graduates, government employees, public school teacher and InLife employees.

During their online graduation event, the scholars presented their final projects to Insular Foundation’s Board of Trustees, project stakeholders from InLife and InLife Health Care (IHC), and representatives from the For the Women Foundation. The capstone projects applied what they learned on the use of large amounts of complex data or big data in the core businesses of InLife and IHC.



“This is a relevant program because data science is a future skill. Data science can really empower and uplift the lives of women.

It is so inspiring to see our scholars with the knowledge and passion to deliver the capstone projects which not only deliver good business value, but most of all deliver positive social impact,” IHC president and CEO Noemi Azura said.


Insular Foundation executive director Ana Soriano congratulated the scholars for diving into data science and analytics which are far from their academic and work experience. “For The Women’s mission is to change women’s lives through intensive technical skills training to enable upward career mobility. Thank you for giving us a chance to sponsor the training of the interested few. Hopefully we can make a big difference in their lives as they begin their journey in data science,” she said."
JG Summit taps data analytics,2021,"MANILA, Philippines — Gokongwei-owned JG Summit Holdings Inc. and  global measurement company NielsenIQ announced a strategic alliance to help gauge changing consumer behavior and improve customer experience.

The collaboration is a first in the Philippines and it  introduces an advanced analytics platform (AAP) that will uncover insights about market demands and transactions to help improve shopping experience.

The partnership between JG Summit unit Data Analytics Ventures Inc. (DAVI) and  NielsenIQ seeks to identify the right price, promotional campaigns, and product assortment to provide better value for Robinsons loyalty members.



DAVI chief executive officer Jojo Malolos said this would help widen the understanding of the “swiftly changing Filipino consumer behavior.”

“We have to go deeper into shopper insights. Through loyalty data, we are able to understand the spending habits of our shoppers and connect the dots to identify new programs to enrich our customer’s lives. These insights can immediately be acted upon through personalized campaigns tailored for specific individuals,” Malolos said.


In addition, the use of new data analysis tools allows retailers like Robinsons Supermarket to work with manufacturers and brands in growing fast moving consumer goods categories in its stores.

"Meet Grace, the healthcare robot COVID-19 created",2021,"HONG KONG - The Hong Kong team behind celebrity humanoid robot Sophia is launching a new prototype, Grace, targeted at the healthcare market and designed to interact with the elderly and those isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dressed in a blue nurse's uniform, Grace has Asian features, collar-length brown hair and a thermal camera in her chest to take your temperature and measure your responsiveness. She uses artificial intelligence to diagnose a patient and can speak English, Mandarin and Cantonese.

""I can visit with people and brighten their day with social stimulation ... but can also do talk therapy, take bio readings and help healthcare providers,"" Grace told Reuters as she stood next to her ""sister"", Sophia, in creator Hanson Robotics' Hong Kong workshop.


Makers of Sophia the robot plan mass rollout amid pandemic
Grace's resemblance to a healthcare professional and capacity for social interaction is aimed at relieving the burden of front-line hospital staff overwhelmed during the pandemic, said founder David Hanson.

""A human-like appearance facilitates trust and natural engagement because we are wired for human face-to-face interactions,"" Hanson said, explaining how Grace can simulate the action of more than 48 major facial muscles, and has a comforting demeanor designed to look a little like anime characters, often a fusion of Asian and Western styles.

Awakening Health intends to mass-produce a beta version of Grace by August, said David Lake, chief executive of the joint venture between Hanson Robotics and Singularity Studio, and there are plans to fully deploy her next year in locations including Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan and Korea.

The cost of making the robots, now akin to luxury car pricing, will decrease once the company is manufacturing tens or hundreds of thousands of units, Hanson added.

Grace's launch comes as the global impact of the coronavirus has made the need for humanoid robots urgent, said Kim Min-Sun, a communicology professor at the University of Hawaii.

Stuck at home during COVID-19 lockdowns, many people have had their mental states affected with negative thoughts.


""If they can get help through the deployment of these social robots in intimate settings, certainly it will have a positive impact on society,"" she said."
"COVID-19 strategy: Here's how Philippines can combat the pandemic, according to a data scientist",2020,"MANILA, Philippines — Aside from implementing an enhanced community quarantine, the Philippines needs to include multiple strategies in its fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Three weeks into the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine Luzon, the national government has yet to decide whether to lift or extend the lockdown.

Task force sees start of mass COVID-19 testing by April 14
Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) spokesperson Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles earlier said science would be ""in charge"" on this matter.

The IATF has a technical working group, headed by the Department of Health, that will ""finalize the parameters for deciding on the eventual total or partial lifting of the ECQ in Luzon, the possible extension of its duration, or its expansion to other areas outside the contained area, subject to the approval, amendment or modification by the IATF.""

Metro Manila epidemic peak projected between April to June
Data scientists from the University of the Philippines project the virus to infect around 600,000 to 1.4 million individuals in the country, with 80% from Metro Manila.


In its report, the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team emphasized the need for community collaboration to fight the deadly virus, which has infected nearly one million people across the globe.

""This estimate includes possible asymptomatic individuals and unreported cases. The high estimate for Metro Manila is mainly due to the high population size and density of the region,"" the UP report read.

This projection is based on a reproduction rate between 1.5 to 4, which is the average number of people that will be directly infected by a COVID-19 positive person in a susceptible population.

Based on mathematical simulations, the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team predicted that the peak of the epidemic in Metro Manila will happen between April and June 2020.

As of April 2, the Philippines has detected 2,633 COVID-19 cases, 1,395 of which are in Metro Manila.

""As the government and the public implement interventions, the peak might shift to a later date and may also be flattened,"" the report read.

Noting that peaks in the provinces might be asynchronous or would not happen at the same time, the UP report pointed out that mobility in and out of provinces should be monitored and regulated to prevent an outbreak.

Multiple strategies suggested in war vs COVID-19
Given these circumstances, the UP pandemic team suggested multiple strategies, in addition to the ECQ, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

These measures include maintaining social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings; inreasing detection and isolation, including mild and asymptomatic cases, to reduce infections; and increasing protection and good personal hygiene to reduce transmission.

UP scientists also proposed to increase clean and safe space and to implement physical distance between random people. 

In hospitals, the report suggested to decrease the rate of patient encounter per health care worker, such as implementing a policy of maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift. Another proposal was to decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and patients, with less than 40 minutes for the whole day.

The report also noted that providing protective gears and facilities to frontline health care workers during their shift is 95% effective.

Extending the community quarantine, in addition to multiple strategies mentioned above, are seen to further ""shift the peak"" of the epidemic to buy more time to prepare.

Philippines needs to prepare for long-term
Data scientist Jomar Rabajante, professor at UP Los Baños Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics, said the war against COVID-19 is not just in a month but may extend until vaccine arrives, which is expected next year.

Thus, the country needs to be prepared not just during the lockdown period but for the long-term.

""So we need more community collaboration to fight COVID. It is imperative to include multiple strategies not just ECQ, as we need to consider other factors such as socio-economic status of our country,"" Rabajante told Philstar.com in an online exchange.

On the lifting of the ECQ, Rabajante said that if the government has solid strategies to move forward, the Philippines can do a modified community quarantine, which means that it would be local government unit-based and not national or Luzon-wide.

The UPLB professor also noted that before considering the lifting of the ECQ, LGUs must be equipped to implement protocols, such as regulated travel and quarantine of persons under monitoring and persons under investigation, to prevent initiation of outbreak.

The country should also have enough hospital beds, equipment, personnel and other healthcare support in case of a surge in the number of cases, he said.

""If the public is already prepared to change their 'epidemic-friendly' practices. That is, can we still maintain physical distancing in public (e.g. inside MRT)? Can we maintain or improve our personal hygiene habits? If not, then it is dangerous,"" Rabajante told Philstar.com.

He also noted that the country's hospitals should also have enough detection capability to identify those who are infected and isolate them immediately. 

While the Philippines has yet to acquire vaccine and COVID-19 drugs, the country should at least have a strategy to control transmission to vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those who have weak immune system.

""If the government can guarantee enough provision of economic resources for vulnerable communities then ECQ can be extended, or else we need modified [community quarantine] where socio-economic factors are considered,"" Rabajante said.

Mass testing to start April 14
On Thursday evening, Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the national policy against COVID-19, announced that the government is planning to start mass testing of PUIs and PUMs starting April 14.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of five rapid test kits for the new coronavirus.

The FDA is also expected to issue a certificate of product registration to locally-made test kids on April 3. These test kits were developed by scientists from the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health and the Philippine Genome Center, which will be manufactured by Manila HealthTek Inc. 

“The Manila HealthTek Inc. reported that the first batch of reagents has arrived which will enable them to start the manufacturing process to create additional kits that can accommodate 120,000 tests,” the DOST earlier said."
Philippines grapples to meet demand for data analysts — PIDS,2020,"MANILA, Philippines — Demand for data analysts in the country is steadily rising, but higher education institutions (HEIs) are not producing enough graduates to fill positions, according to a new paper by the Philippine Institute for Developing Studies (PIDS).

The policy note titled “Aligning higher education with demands for data science workforce” said skills needed for data science and analytics in the country remain underdeveloped in the Philippine workforce.

“With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, however, comes the increasing demand for data science and analytics workforce which can help mitigate this issue on employment. Sadly, DSA skills remain underdeveloped among the Philippine workforce,” PIDS said.



“Behind this is the school- industry gap, wherein educational institutions fail to hone skills that meet industry demands,” it added.

The study found that several undergraduate degrees in the country have been providing the pathway for DSA professionals but currently do not provide specific training.


These include computer science, business administration, statistics, mathematics, information technology, library and information science, economics, physics, industrial engineering, and civil engineering.

Among these programs, industrial engineering and computer science were the best stepping stones to a DSA career.

In 2019, these 10 DSA-related programs produced 176,597 professionals but only 38 percent or 62,583 workers were assessed as ready for shift in the high demand DSA field.

This was short of the 81,078 DSA job roles that needed to be filled.

The study also found a misalignment between the type of DSA workers sought by employers and the type of DSA graduates produces by HEIs in 2019.

For example, demand was highest for functional analyst at 66 percent of the demand but HEIs produced mostly data engineers at 74 percent of the supply.

“The findings indicated a scarcity of DSA competencies in the current workforce and a misalignment between the demand and supply of DSA professionals in the country,” PIDS said.

“Such misalignment can be attributed to the fact that DSA is still at its infancy in the Philippines,” it added.

The Analytics Association of the Philippines (AAP) defines analytics as the “process of progressing data along the value chain as it transforms data to information to insight to imperatives with the purpose of delivering the right decision support to the right people and digital processes at the right time for the good of society.”

To address the skills mismatch and shortage, PIDS urged the AAP to promote understanding among stakeholders regarding the competencies that need to be developed among graduates.

“Currently, AAP’s professional maturity model is being enhanced and can be an appropriate starting point in aligning the demand and supply of DSA workers and competencies in the country,” said PIDS.

Relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) are also urged to collaborate with industry players more efficiently through policies and programs fitting to the industry needs.

“The government must also increase the public’s awareness of the DSA profession so students can choose a DSA career by taking related undergraduate programs,” it added.

Science and data,2020,"Whenever it comes to policy issues and problems related to efforts in containing the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, science and data are repeatedly invoked as the guide and basis of whatever final decision is taken by President Rodrigo Duterte. In his most recent public address to the Filipino people aired last Tuesday, President Duterte practically admitted his decision-making process has been rendered “inutile” by science and data.

If he alone to decide, President Duterte would continue with the lockdown in the Philippines. The enhanced community quarantines have so far kept in check the rise of COVID-19 contagion all over the country. However, from the start of the stringent community quarantines last March 15 until gradually relaxed beginning June, the consequences of the lockdown in the mobility of people, goods and services manifested its impact to the Philippine economy.

The Philippine economic growth, as measured in the terms of gross domestic product (GDP) or total production inside the country, shrunk to near zero level for the first six months of this year. Based from science and data, in fact, Albay Rep.Joey Salceda projects the Philippine economy will further shrink to as low as negative 6 to 10 percent for the rest of the year while COVID-19 cases rise to six-digit numbers. Salceda made the dire forecast during our weekly breakfast news forum Kapihan sa Manila Bay Zoom Webinar last Wednesday.

Citing science and data information from epidemiologists, medical and other health experts, Salceda concurred with the bleak projection of the World Health Organization (WHO) that the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the entire global community will persist for much longer period than previously anticipated. Until an anti-COVID vaccine is fully developed, Salceda revealed the dire prognosis of science and data gathered by his office.

The House resident economist fears the COVID cases in the Philippines to peak at 500,000 Filipinos infected to as high as 1.2 million by year-end. That is, unless testing, isolation quarantines, treatment and care are stepped up against the spread of this deadly flu-like disease in our country, he urged.


“Once vaccine is available and necessary measures are put in place, we may be able to bend the curve by January,” Salceda predicted with a tinge of confidence.

This is why Salceda vows to push the completion of the pending legislation of four key economic stimulus package designed to enable a quick recovery of the Philippines from the COVID-19 contagion. Thus, he stressed, the package of economic stimulus bills will comprise the urgent priority legislative agenda that they will tackle in the second regular sessions kicked off by the joint opening ceremonies of the 18th Congress this Monday, July 27.

A high priority is the proposed extension of the emergency powers granted to President Duterte under “Bayanihan Heal As One” Act. This lapsed last June 25. According to Salceda, both the Senate and the House have approved on second reading the proposed P140-billion Bayanihan-2, or We Recover As One bill. When they return to sessions, he declared, it will go through its speedy final approval into law.

Salceda is known to religiously go by science and data before making any policy recommendation or suggestions. A veteran lawmaker and Governor of Albay for three consecutive terms, he is also known to be sought after for consultation or advice by the country’s Chief Executive, present and past on key financial operations affecting the State. Salceda chairs the powerful House committee on ways and means that recommend tax reform and revenue bills, a number of which President Duterte had signed into law.

At the same Kapihan sa Manila Bay Webinar last Wednesday, Anak-Kalusugan party list representative Mike Defensor disclosed another top priority bill is the proposed “New Normal Act” seeking to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country. According to Defensor, the Lower House approved this on third and final reading last June 3, or two days before both chambers adjourned sine die their first regular sessions. The House-approved “New Normal Act” bill remains pending though at the Senate, he rued.

Defensor who chairs the House committee on public accounts, identified himself as among co-authors of this House measure. The critical program under the proposed “New Normal Act” bill, Defensor explained, is to expand the national broadband program under the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). This is to complement the digital platform being put in place by the Department of Education as a safe mode for schoolchildren in lieu of face-to-face classes amid the COVID-19 threat, he pointed out.

Likewise, Defensor added, the bill targets to promote the so-called electronic commerce as the new normal of doing business, especially to encourage many Filipinos who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is to specially protect both the sellers and buyers on the growing popularity of online digital business platform for Medium-Small-Micro Enterprises.

Also the “New Normal Act” bill, he said, seeks to enlist the local government units (LGUs) in the enforcement of mandatory wearing of facemasks as principal personal protective equipment for all. As proposed, failure to wear masks in public places has penalty provisions. For first offense, a fine of P1,000 fine, plus one day mandatory community service and for repeat offense, one day imprisonment, plus fine and community service.

The “New Normal Act,” he noted, seeks to provide also for data tracking system with the Department of Health (DOH) in the monitoring of COVID-19 infection all over our country. “It’s a very comprehensive law under a new normal,” Defensor quipped.

Sadly, COVID-19 appears to be far more than just a science and data issue with so many lives lost already.

Having this deadly public health emergency problem to unnecessarily linger on, the science and data could only do so much to save lives.\"
UnionBank appoints world-leading Data Scientist to further advance digital capabilities,2020,"Consistent with its commitment to make banking simpler and more inclusive via best-in-class digital and mobile capabilities, Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) recently appointed global data science expert Dr. David Hardoon Ph. D., as the Bank’s Senior Advisor for Data and Artificial Intelligence (D & AI), reporting to President and CEO Edwin R. Bautista.

The announcement was made as the Bank continues to see a surge in digital transactions among customers as a result of evolving consumer behavior amplified by the current enhanced community quarantine.  These transactions mean an increased volume of data running through the Bank’s systems which data science and AI can unlock to allow the Bank to serve its customers better. 

“Leveraging Data and AI is a key driver to our next-level of digital transformation as we continue to put the customer – both individuals and businesses – at the heart of our business,” said UnionBank President and CEO Edwin Bautista in a statement.



Dr. Hardoon replaces John Januszczak, who is now focused in his role as president and CEO of UBX, UnionBank’s fintech subsidiary. 

Dr. Hardoon is a graduate of Royal Halloway, the University of London with First-Class Honors B.Sc. in Computer Science and AI, and a holder of a PhD in Machine Learning from the University of Southampton School of Electronics and Computer Science United Kingdom. 

Prior to his appointment at UnionBank, Dr. Hardoon was the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS, Singapore’s counterpart of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) first appointed Chief Data Officer and Head of the Data Analytics Group, and subsequently MAS’ Special Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. In these roles, he led the development of the AI strategy both for MAS and Singapore’s financial sector as well as efforts in promoting open cross-border data flow. 

In addition, he led and established the ASEAN Advanced Analytics of Ernst & Young Advisory Singapore as Director of EY Data, IT Advisory Services, and co-founded Azendian Solutions Pte.

UBX has so far launched three platform start-ups:
– i2i, which connects Filipinos from far-flung areas to the country’s main financial network, has onboarded 53 rural banks with more than 900 branches onto its blockchain platform;
-BUX, a digital payment and logistics fulfillment platform for e-commerce merchants, has enlisted close to 30,000 digital merchants since its launch in December 2019; and,
– SeekCap, an online lending marketplace for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), has signed up over 6,000 MSMEs and reported a 300 percent increase in loans application in the first quarter.

UnionBank chair Justo Ortiz, for his part, highlighted the role that innovation and reinvention were playing in saving companies from extinction. “As we navigate through the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we are building our business model cognizant of certain megatrends, which our strategic scenario planning has identified as opportunities only if we dare greatly,” he said.

The bank, which started its digital transformation eight years ago, reported a relatively smooth transition into operating under the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). The bank also achieved record highs in the month of March in terms of digital account opening in its UnionBank Online app, as well as corporate enrollment into its platform, The Portal.

In March, online account openings surged by 2,680 times the level seen in the same month last year. Enrollments at The Portal increased to 701 in March from 485 in February and 173 in March.

“The shift in customer behavior we’re seeing today may very well be the precursor of the digital tipping point,” Bautista said.

From day one of the ECQ in mid-March, Bautista reported that the bank was able to enforce 90 percent work-from-home (WFH) arrangement for its headquarter employees, while performing all the critical banking operations.

About 93 percent of the bank’s branches remained open in the first weeks of the lockdown. Furthermore, Bautista noted that UnionBank’s Ark branches had long been configured in such a way that physical contact/face-to-face interactions were minimized through social distancing configuration, self-service machines, and digital queueing platform.

“This crisis has shown that with digital capabilities, a bank can be run from home; that businesses will adjust to a cashless environment; and that we don’t have to go to a branch to perform our banking needs,” he said. “Despite the crisis, there is no reason to slow down our digital transformation, rather we should accelerate it.”

UnionBank also introduced its “Bank on Wheels” initiative and deployed them to areas with large transaction needs. It launched the “Send Money to Remittance Centers” capability in its UnionBank Online app, enabling customers to send money online to the 10,000 locations of remittance partners.

A data revolution for all,2020,"NEW YORK — Pick any problem you see around the world: the raging wildfires that are devastating Australia; the opioid epidemic that is ravaging poor communities in the United States; the world’s worst refugee crisis since World War II. Confronting these problems and others — from poverty and inequality to conservation and climate change — requires the responsible application of data, and the insights drawn from them.

Yet, while there have been great advances in data science in the private sector, many social-sector and civic organizations are lagging behind. With proper support, they can leverage data analytics to make their work go further and faster, ultimately helping more people. By becoming more data-science driven, all organizations can achieve their full potential.

ADVERTISEMENT

Fortunately, innovators in the field are already performing some of this work. The volunteer-based organization DataKind, for example, has connected nonprofits with private-sector data scientists to solve issues facing community health workers. Data-driven insights have also been used to help mayors across the United States pursue strategies of inclusive economic growth, and to help government officials in Africa predict the locations and causes of at-risk pregnancies in rural communities. And yet, these efforts represent merely the starting point, not the final destination. There is still so much more work to do.

Transforming the role of data in addressing major social and economic issues is not a job for any one person or organization. We must build on the successes of those who have come before. In 2002, a group of innovative social entrepreneurs, together with antipoverty advocates and the Irish rock musician and philanthropist Bono, launched DATA, a nonprofit committed to alleviating debt, fighting AIDS, and reducing trade inequalities in Africa. In what ultimately became the ONE Campaign, they galvanized support for poverty alleviation by focusing on real-world data, and by advocating evidence-based approaches to development. The coalition behind DATA facilitated the cancellation of $100 billion of debt owed by poor countries, marshaled $50 billion in contributions for health and development aid, and pushed for trade deals that helped millions of vulnerable families.

But, although data are ubiquitous, and the opportunities offered by the data revolution are even larger, not everyone is poised to gain from it equally. Once again, we need a bold effort to bridge the gap and ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind.

With that challenge in mind, The Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard are relaunching DATA.org to serve as a platform for partnerships to expand further the field of data science for social impact, and to ensure that nonprofit and civic organizations are well positioned to take advantage of the data revolution.


By relaunching the platform, we hope to use data to tackle homelessness, improve access to social benefits, and support community health workers worldwide. Those on the front lines of efforts to improve public health, fight poverty, and solve many other problems will have improved access to data scientists who can help them maximize their impact. Most important, this will be done in a way that brings more people and organizations together to effect positive social change, all while adhering to principles of responsible data use.

The data revolution must benefit all. Together, we can make 2020 the year that partnerships began to extend the promise of a data-driven economy to everyone, everywhere. Project Syndicate

The sexiest job of the 21st century,2019,"Data science and data analytics are topics that I never thought would be the topic of my column. These are topics best left to technology sections. But I was definitely intrigued when I saw a Harvard Business Review article that had the title “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” If that is the case, then this is a topic the average readers should start familiarizing themselves with. I also discovered that two of the Philippines’ major educational institutions – De La Salle University and the Asian Institute of Management – have started offering graduate courses in Data Science.

The HBR article defines the “data scientist” as a high ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data. Data science has been defined as the use of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Another well known writer on modern science, Jim Gray, described data science as the “fourth paradigm of science,” explaining that the first three paradigms of science were “theoretical, empirical and computational.” The latest paradigm is now “data-driven.” For those who are regular watchers of the television series Big Bang Theory will remember that Sheldon prided himself on being a “theoretical physicist,” the apex of scientific fields. Well, a new replacement series could replace him with a data scientist.

Like all the other new technologies, the term data science was coined only recently – 2008 – by D.J. Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher, then the respective leads of data and analytic efforts at LinkedIn and Facebook. Today, thousands of data scientists are already working at both start-ups and well established companies. Here is what the HBR article wrote:

“Their (data scientists) sudden appearance on the business scene reflects the fact that companies are now wrestling with information that comes in varieties and volumes never encountered before. If your organization stores multiple petabytes of data, if the information most critical to your business resides in forms other than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your biggest question would involve a ‘mashup’ of several analytical efforts, you’ve got a big data opportunity.

Much of the current enthusiasm for big data focuses on technologies that make taming it possible, including Hadoop (the most widely used framework for distributed file system processing) and related open source tools, cloud computing and data visualization. While those are important breakthroughs, at least as important are the people with the skill set (and the mindset) to put them to good use. On this front, demand has outpaced supply. Indeed, the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors.“


Any understanding of data science requires also knowledge of another term, data analytics. This is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. These techniques can reveal trends that would otherwise be lost in the mass of information. Any type of information can be subjected to data analytic techniques to get insight that can be used to improve processes or spot trends. For example, manufacturing companies often record downtime, runtime and work queue for various machines and then analyze the data to better plan the workloads so the machines operate closer to capacity.

Gaming companies use data analytics to set reward schedules for players that keep the majority of players active in the game. Content companies, like social media companies, use data analytics to keep a person clicking, watching or reorganizing content to get another view or another click.

There are new slang words that have arisen due to the rise of this new science. The term “quant” is slang for an expert in the use of mathematics and related subjects, particularly in investment management. But what happens if you are a “non-quant,” can you still exploit data analytics? HBR has another article that shows how to make “Analytics Based Decision Making in Six Easy Steps:

1. Recognize the problem or the question. Frame the decision or business problem, and identify possible alternatives to the framing.

2. Review previous findings. Identify people who have tried to solve this problem or similar ones – and the approaches they used.

3. Model the solution and select the variables. Formulate a detailed hypothesis about how particular variables affect the outcome.

4. Collect the data. Gather primary and secondary data on the hypothesis variables.

5. Anayze the data. Run a statistical model, assess its appropriateness for the data, and repeat the process until a good fit is found.

6. Present and act on the results. Use the data to tell a story to decision makers and stakeholders so they will take action.

In this new world of data analytics, businessmen must learn to combine the science of analytics with the art of intuition. Warren Buffett once said: “Beware of geeks...bearing formulas.” But, the HBR article contends that in today’s data driven world, one cannot afford to ignore “geeks.” Instead, the advice is to be a manager who knows the geeks, understands their formulas, helps improve their analytic processes, effectively interprets and communicates the findings to others, and makes better decisions.

Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, said: “The sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. People think I’m joking, but who would have guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy job of the 1990s?”

The inevitability of data science and data analytics as basic tools in business is inevitable. There will come a time – very soon – when even small and medium sized firms in all industries will need to apply these tools to remain competitive – to survive. The advance of big data shows no sign of slowing. It is in fact accelerating. As Professor Thomas Davenport wrote: “Think of big data as an epic wave gathering now, starting to crest. If you want to catch it, you need people who can surf.” You will need people who understand data science."
"Roadmap to a data-driven, analytically-competitive Philippines",2019,"MANILA, Philippines —  In agricultural areas, seasoned farmers have long known about when to plant and what to plant so that they can sustain their livelihood. But this is being challenged. Recently, we are seeing times when certain crops re under- or over-produced; both scenarios seriously affecting their livelihood. Furthermore, changing weather patterns have affected yield rates.

 In urban areas, millions of call center agents receive service requests and complaints from local and international customers of their main clients. They probably know more about their client’s customers than their main clients?

We are a rich nat ion data -wise but . . .
In the digital age, data is the new natural resource, and the Philippines is one of the largest producers.



Over 25 percent of the Filipino workforce is employed in the agriculture industry, including the hunting and forestry

sectors. This means that our farmers and our fisherfolk have a lot of stock knowledge on how to efficiently grow the industry.


The BPO industry contributes more than 10 percent of our GDP. This means that a vast majority of customer data of the clients these BPO companies serve are created in the country.

Millions of Filipinos spend an average of almost four hours a day on social media sites — the highest social media usage in the world. This means that we contribute a lot to the data that is being collected by these social media sites.

However, like any natural resource, data should be mined and refined properly, efficiently, and ethically to truly bring about good for our society. We lag behind our ASEAN neighbors in the mining and refining of data for economic development, though we are catching up rather quickly.

Building the analyt cs ecosystem of the philippines
In 2016, the Analytics Association of the Philippines (AAP) was established with a mission to “develop the ecosystem that makes the Philippines a data-driven country, and globally competitive in and a leading talent source of Analytics and other emerging Analytics-enabled disciplines (such as Artificial Intelligence) for the good of society.”

To realize this mission, a starting point had to be established. The approach was to offer a shared definition of Analytics, a set of the major Analytics job families, a list of Analytics skills and competencies, and maturity models for professionals and organizations.

With these models being comprehensive (but not complicated), enduring, and valuable to professionals and organizations, the AAP had to ensure that these models have global references. Having a globally recognized framework means that Filipino professionals and organizations who will adapt this framework can be globally competitive as well. As such, the AAP turned to studies done by the Business-Higher Education Forum from North

America, by Project EDISON from Europe, and from Project DARE (Data Analytics Raising Employment) from the APEC region.

Building blocks of a data -driven Philippines
To properly, efficiently, and ethically mine and refine the data that we produce for economic development, the AAP posits that our country must develop a certain maturity level in certain Analytics capabilities and assets including:

Data. We must be relentless in search for new data, leveraging all varieties of data including text, image, and video. As a country, we need to view data as a strategic asset.

Practitioners. We need to have professionals both technical and industry-savvy who are highly capable in Analytics and other emerging Analytics-enabled disciplines. The country must be able to develop, provide life-long employability, and keep these professionals highly engaged.

Technology. The country needs to invest more in infrastructure such as hardware, software, network connectivity and bandwidth to transform data to its full potential.

Analytical Techniques. We need to employ various analytical techniques ranging from simple descriptive statistics to advanced machine learning to, again, get the most relevant insights from data.

More importantly, the country needs to build a countrywide data culture that includes:

Goals. As a country, we need to be able to select the right, strategic, countrywide and/or region-specific targets that will be the core of an Analytics roadmap.

Leadership. We need to have strong, committed leadership that understands the importance of Analytics and constantly advocates their use in decision and actions.

Our journey has begun
The AAP has successfully tested and incubated this framework in pilot programs with the University of Asia and the Pacific (academe), and in Pointwest Technologies Corporation (private sector). The AAP is also collaborating with

various government agencies starting with a memorandum of agreement with DOST-PCIEERD on Data Science Cooperation.

With these programs and with these building blocks in place, our journey to an analytically-competitive Philippines continues as we start rolling out mining and refining activities to the data that we produce.

We can draw insights from the collective knowledge of our farmers and fisherfolk injecting other variables such as weather patterns, soil type and water supply availability. This is done with the goal of producing just the right volume of crops at the right time.

We can add even more value to the services we provide within our BPO sector by providing clients insights to their

own customers that they may not otherwise glean from millions of records produced regularly. Such insights could be turned into action that will provide end users with better customer experience.

And lastly, we can have better use of social media by being able to identify, gather, and analyze the factors that will contribute to a happier general public.

Data-driven solutions banner VSTECS CXO Innovation Summit 2019,2019,"MANILA,Philippines — To help organizations benefit from the advances in technologies, dozens of tech stalwarts from the leading names in information technology across the Asia and the Pacific recently gathered in the Philippines to grace the second CXO Innovation Summit at Shangri-La Boaracay.

Organized by VSTECS Phils. Inc. (formerly known as MSI-ECS Phils. Inc.) the summit was attended by delegates from the government, business leaders, entrepreneurs, computer scientists and academics who are on the lookout for data-driven solutions to long-standing social and economic challenges posed by today’s exiting information technology infrastructure. Centered around the theme “Data Driven Enterprise: Harnessing the Power of Data,” the three-day conference featured a great number of talks and discussions concerning the flourishing IT sector





Innovators lead breakout sessions
To spearhead the first day of the summit, industry innovators shared thought-provoking insights best practices and industry trends during the breakout sessions — 32 simultaneous presentations spread across all six halls of Shangri-La Boracay — that tackled everything from Internet-of-Things (IOT), digital workspaces, big data, cyber security, threat detection and response, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud storage and network connectivity.

These breakout sessions presented a healthy variety of topics, as well as laid out growth roadmaps and successful templates that can be applied by Philippine-based companies and organizations as they figure out how to best navigate the evolving tech landscape.


Tech stalwarts steer plenary discussions
On the second day, tech stalwarts from the leading names in information technology presented data-driven solutions that can help local CIOs (chief information officers) and chief technology officers (CTOs) address emerging threats and challenges.

Discussions were led by Dell Technologies chief technology presales APJ Lee Siong Fey (DellTechnologies Multi-cloud Strategy), Huawei Enterprise Business Group CTO principal architect Patrick Low (Leading New ICT to Digital Transformation-Make a Difference with Huawei), HPE Growth & Emerging Markets regional managing director Daniel Aw (Preparing the Next Wave of Digital Transformation), Cisco ASEAN Digital Transformation Office director Nishant Dave (Building the Bridge to Multicloud: Powering the Application Revolution), IBM Security Software and Services ASEAN business unit executive Malcolm Rowe (Data Resilience and The Laws of Cybersecurity), Schneider Electric Business VP for Secure Power Tony Kang (Digital Evolution in the Cloud and at the Edge), Samsung Mobile B2B Asia corporate VP David Kim (Next Mobile Economy), Aruba South East Asia and Taiwan senior director and GM Justin Chiah (Experience the Edge), Oracle Cloud Platform, APAC, Japan and EMEA Group VP and chief architect Christopher Chelliah (From Data to Insights…Fast!) and Lenovo Data Center Group, APAC and General Manager HPC and AI, APAC CTO Jonathan Wu (Pushing the Boundaries of Data).

Harnessing the power of data
This year’s summit gathered more delegates and featured added topics compared to last year’s highly successful pilot launch, in an event that served as a platform to discuss the issues, challenges, and, most importantly, best practices that come with transforming businesses into data-driven organizations. 

“There is no doubt that in today’s economy, most companies, if not all, are aware of the importance of data. A new culture of data-driven decision-making has emerged and in fact, some have already started to enjoy the rewards of big data. These are just of the scenarios on how big data has changed the business landscape. While we all agree that there is now a rapid stream of data from mobile devices and social network-connected machines, what really counts is the quality of data. How do you identify quality data? How do you manage and organize them? Where do you begin you data analysis and what tools are you going to use to analyze them?” exclaims VSTECS Phils., Inc. president and CEO Jimmy Go, on the importance of data on today’s digitally-powered world.    

The CXO Innovation Summit 2019 was made possible with the efforts of VSTECS and its partner sponsors: Aruba, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Lenovo, Oracle, Samsung, Schneider Electric Fortinet, Trend Micro, Avaya, FireEye, Hitachi, Juniper Networks, Microsoft, Riverbed, Rubrik, VMWare, ASUS, Nutanix SAS and Go Qloud."
"AI, machine learning changing the way of business",2018,"Today, every organization needs to reimagine its business model. Customers expect business to meet them anywhere, any time, on any device. To meet this speed of response, businesses need to be ahead of the game, at the cutting edge of what their market is capable of doing and informed by real-time data.

To make this possible, businesses need to adopt cloud systems. Cloud is the direction of the digital age. Some still see cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) as the future, but I’d argue it’s what businesses need now. It’s not coming, it’s here.

ADVERTISEMENT

Worldwide spending on public cloud services is forecast to reach £204 billion in 2021, according to the latest International Data Corp. (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide. In 2017, it will reach £98 billion, an increase of 25 percent over 2016 spend and at S/4HANA Cloud, our adoption has grown by more than 70 percent year-on-year.

What forces are driving the business case? All the evidence points toward three advantages of intelligent cloud ERP: instant use, intelligent software, and innovative capabilities.

Instant use

The business case for intelligent cloud ERP is not about reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), but about simplifying the user experience to drive productivity. It’s about changing every business into a digital business. With no servers, no front-end rollout, no monolithic change management, the vendor provides it all without any time wasted.

While on-site implementations often take the better part of a year, an intelligent cloud ERP should be available for use in a fraction of the time. With the right system, you can expect implementations in a 12-16 week timeframe.

Another huge advantage is the pace at which intelligent cloud ERP can deploy the latest technology. Customers can expect regular, scheduled updates, expanding their capabilities as new tools using machine learning reach the enterprise.

Intelligent software

The future of software is in applications that learn from the business, provide information in context, and offer real-time analytics derived from big data. For enterprise software, machine learning and AI are already making this happen.

Machine learning and AI hold tremendous potential for enterprise. Think about the benefit of software that can predict what information users need in any given context. By learning from its users, an ERP becomes a system that interacts with and anticipates their needs, not a reactive platform that requires direction.

ADVERTISEMENT

S/4HANA Cloud’s recent 1705 upgrade introduced SAP CoPilot —our first intelligent digital assistant for the enterprise space. It’s intuitive to use, highly intelligent and contextualized behind the scenes, providing customers with an effective tool for managing their businesses.

There are few things machine learning and real-time analytics cannot do: transaction fraud detection, assessing CVs or making procurement smarter through contextual analytics on suppliers. Already the potential is incredibly compelling.

Innovative capabilities

Intelligent cloud ERP features a “fit to standard” model. It remains simple and intuitive and provides best practices for common business functions, streamlining processes and removing complexity.

This a feature—not a limitation. For businesses that have truly unique areas, as is often the case with SMEs, intelligent cloud ERP provides more freedom for extensibility than traditional on-premises systems. The platform’s standardized format means that third parties, including users, can build on it with industry-specific extensions. With a variety of business models and processes, this is an essential consideration for SMEs and in the first half of 2017 they constituted more than 60 percent of all new S/4HANA customers.

Embracing the business case

The ability to start small and see the rapid time to value is one reason intelligent cloud ERP is becoming the platform of choice and demonstrating real business value for those who embrace it.

All the benefits are here today—and the cloud model is only getting more compelling. Customers select the service, bring their users and data, and vendors provide the rest. Cloud is here and it’s in every company’s best interest to start harnessing the benefits.

Cashalo banks on data science to provide credit to the unbanked,2018,"MANILA – The Gokongwei group's financial technology venture Cashalo was using data science to help unbanked Filipinos get access to credit, it's general manager said Monday.

Cashalo uses technology to create credit scores for borrowers, which then give them access to loans. This eliminates the need to borrow from informal lenders that charge ""exorbitant"" amount, its general manager Hamilton Angluben told ANC.

Data such as social media accounts and contact lists, among others, could help the unbanked get access to as much as P10,000 in loans, Angluben said.


“Cashalo leverages on data science and technology and the smartphone, so with the borrowers permission and consent we were able to pull different kinds of data,” Angluben said.

The Gokongweis and Hong Kong-based Oriente invested an initial P10 billion over 3 years for Cashalo in June.

Gokongwei group's app-based loan service promises low interest rates
Angluben said the app was downloaded 500,000 times.

Aside from cash loans, the fintech company is testing its “consumer purchase” loan scheme which can be used to purchase appliances in retail stores, Angluben said.

The model could succeed in the country because of the the Bangko Sentral's support to technology and financial inclusion, Angluben said.

Cashalo has a huge potential to grow since some 40 million people have no access to formal credit, co-founder Lance Gokongwei earlier said.

Monsanto readies digital farming in PH,2016,"The Monsanto Co. sees the Philippines as fertile ground for the adoption of data science in farming as it readies high-tech solutions for the application of so-called big data analytics in agriculture.

Hazel Bograd, Monsanto data science and analytics manager for Asia Pacific, says that in the context of farming, data science helps make sense of complex interactions that happen on the field by bringing together resources such as historical yield data, climate imagery, and information on soil and moisture.

“This in turn provides farmers with critical insights they can use to make important crop management decisions throughout the planting season,” Bograd says.

Previously limited to technology-heavy industries like telecommunications, logistics, and healthcare, the use of insights gleamed from huge chunks of data—thus, Big Data —is now spreading to other enterprise applications including in agriculture.

Bograd says data science also helps Monsanto innovate to produce stronger, healthier crops that are climate-resilient and disease-tolerant.

“As global production is complicated by climate variability and by increasing demand for food due to increasing population, data science is a valuable tool to drive better outcomes in the field,” she says.

Monsanto is among the biggest provider of genetically modified seeds in the Philippines, which is one of the biggest producers of GM corn in the world.

Bograd says the company aims to be the leader in smart farming through big data analytics, investing heavily toward this end.

“Monsanto invested $1 billion in (the acquisition of) The Climate Corp., which manages with leading expertise a wide range of digital tools that provide insights to farmers,” she says.

The company, now a Monsanto division, gives recommendations, such as planting a few days earlier or changing an irrigation schedule. Such practical tips are meant to help farmers—regardless of size or preferred production practice—produce more while increasing the efficient use of resources.

Bograd says Monsanto and Climate Corp. are currently piloting in South Africa a way of using data science by aggregating small farms for economies of scale.

“Of course, this has been done in advanced markets like the United States and Canada, but what we are doing in South Africa is intended to bring ‘digitized agriculture’ into varied markets like the Philippines,” she adds.

Initially, data science in Philippine farms may be more appropriate to large operations, but Bograd sees the potential in using this down the scale—Filipino corn farmers who till smaller but all together numerous plots of land.

The use of big data in agriculture is also helping farmers around the globe gain valuable farm-level insights necessary for precision planting. Field-level insights, such as soil health and climate patterns, are especially important to farmers as they make 40 to 50 critical decisions involving various factors such as how much they can grow and how efficiently they can do it.

Bograd says that, among corn farmers in the Philippines, climatic information and forecasts are major considerations before planting. Decisions inappropriate to climatic conditions result in 75 percent of yearly losses in farm production, she says.

She adds that farmers sourcing seeds from Monsanto are now using advanced field-tracking tools, such as plant sensors and weather satellites, to measure and analyze all the interactions happening on the field—including soil moisture, rainfall, plant health, and temperatures.

After conducting analysis, a field-by-field prescription to the farmers is given, recommending the best hybrid variety to plant, as well as the water and crop protection products to apply to the fields, among others.

“Understanding the unique challenges and conditions of the field allows farmers to maximize every harvest season,” Bograd says. “By harnessing these digital technologies, we are able to put valuable information into the hands of farmers to help them be more productive on each hectare of their land.”

Using such high technology in farming at a large scale, she says, is becoming necessary as interconnected challenges of rising population, increasing food consumption and depleting natural resources—like water and land—are putting pressure on local food production.

The population in Asia alone is expected to grow to 5.9 billion by 2050, while demand for food is expected to rise by 60 percent to 70 percent. Thus, experts are warning that as early as 2025, a hectare of farmland that previously produced food for two people will have to feed five people.

2015 Science awardees seek solutions to current issues,2015,"Laboratory work may not be as glamorous or as rewarding as a career in finance, but basic scientific research is essential to national development.

Some banks or insurance companies award talent in picking stocks or building portfolios, but for more than 25 years now the Bank of the Philippine Islands, with the Department of Science and Technology, has recognized remarkable work in Science by college students.

Eight college seniors and their scientific projects went on to the finals. The three most outstanding ones were recognized recently at the Mind Museum in Taguig City.

Banana wilt caused by a fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4) has devastated plantations in the country and abroad. Christian John S. Capirig (Bachelor of Science in Biology) of Ateneo de Davao University looked into the possibility of using certain bacteria to fight the fungus.

Capirig initially chose three soil bacteria. Using culture and bioassay, he discovered that two bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) were quite promising.

The project was declared the grand winner but Capirig recommends more studies to establish the bacteriaÆs antifungal properties.


Oil and water do not mix well, but when accidents happen, how do we separate them? Tanker ship accidents and the spills they cause have extensively damaged marine life and the ecosystem.

Raiza Elmira S. Imperial (BS Chemistry) of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman was first runner-up for developing a clever fabrication of a special coating of polythiophene on a steel mesh. The coating is superhydrophobic (hates water) and superoleophilic (loves oil).

To test the coated mesh, Imperial used various water samples, solvents and petroleum products. Results showed that water of various acidity did not pass through the mesh, while gasoline, kerosene and crude oil easily made it through.

Second runner-up Alron Jan F. Lam (BS Computer Science, specializing in Software Technology) of De La Salle University developed project Breadcrumb to improve computer systems’ estimates of motion.

Ordinary computers might have reached their processing and speed limits   but the next-generation quantum computers should be a lot faster at data optimization, materials simulation and other well-defined tasks.

Quantum computers rely on quantum entanglement, among other processes, to perform simultaneous large-scale computations.

Going back to bacteria that can also be useful, Ma. Celina L. Guillermo (BS Life Sciences) of Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) focused on a unique specimen, the magnetotactic bacteria, so called because they produce extremely small (nano-sized) magnetic particles that enable cells to move according to the earth’s geomagnetic field.

Magnetotactic bacteria were virtually unknown but through genetic sequencing of a particular sediment in Nagsasa, Zambales province, Guillermo studied its properties. The strain, known as ADMU-10, is so far only the third strain belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria class.

Further studies of this microorganism may hopefully lead to indigenous and inexpensive nanoparticles that can be used to detect cancer cells and other diseases.

For diseases to be successfully treated, targeted drugs have to be properly absorbed by the body. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is touted as an ideal material for drug delivery, tissue engineering and cell cultures, but it is not easily compatible with water.

James Nicolas M. Pagaduan (BS Chemistry/BS Materials Science and Engineering) of ADMU tried to make PCL more suitable by using glycerol.

The study was cautiously optimistic. Glycerol-modified PCL became partially soluble in methanol. It also had more affinity with water than ordinary PCL.

Pagaduan recommends further exploration of possible applications in sutures (surgical stitches), capsules and controlled-release drugs.

Environmentalists dream of renewable energy sources, but they are not always stable. So energy from sunlight or wind has to be stored in batteries and supercapacitors.

Studies around the world are underway to create storage materials that can be used with wearable and portable electronics. 

Ina Andreia O. Mauleon (BS Chemistry) of the University of Santo Tomas has come up with a native electrode material: The buri fabric (raffia).

To make raffia conductive, Mauleon brushed it with regular carbon black and self-dispersible carbon black. She discovered that the latter had better conductivity, higher surface area and higher specific capacitance.

Cutting-edge technology

How can rescue operations communicate with those in disaster-stricken areas? Base stations connect with existing telecommunications systems and televisionÆs white space is used as frequency because it has a lot of unused spectra.

But transmitted signals have to be amplified first and the messages filtered.

Steven Matthew C. Cheng (BS Electronics and Communications Engineering) of UP Diliman worked on a UHF bidirectional amplifier that operated within the UHF TV band (450 to 900 megahertz).

Tests with plug-and-play UHF radios and antennas showed that automatic switching between transmit and receive modes was achieved.

The global positioning system works well outdoors. Indoors there is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). With a smartphone, a person can find his/her way by keeping track of his/her position and mapping the environment.

One way SLAM works is through inertial navigation systems that estimate motion based on the number of steps taken.

But the systems are prone to sensor errors, so cameras are needed to correct them. The solution, however, leads to another problem. The cameras may manage sensor problems successfully, but they have poor motion estimation. 

Xavier M. Puspus (BS Applied Physics) of the National Institute of Physics in UP Diliman studied quantum entanglement in low-temperature superconductors.

Calculations showed interesting results: Devices can be calibrated to ensure optimum entanglement and the study can serve as a bridge between quantum information theory and statistical mechanics.

ABS-CBN moves first in shift to digital TV,2014,"MANILA, Philippines - Multimedia giant ABS-CBN Corp. said it has the first-mover advantage in the roll out of digital terrestrial television using the Japanese technology, having invested in the impending shift a few years ago.

ABS-CBN chairman Eugenio Lopez III said the broadcast firm invested early in the adoption of Japan â€™s Integrated Service Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial or ISDB-T standard.

â€œWell, we placed our bets early and have already invested in this standard. We are probably three years ahead of everybody else in terms of rolling out digital TV, so this should give us first-mover advantage as the country transitions from analog to digital,â€ Lopez stressed.



He pointed out that ABS-CBN is ready to expand its free-to-air channel once the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the impending shift to digital terrestrial TV using the Japanese technology is issued by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC).

â€œWe are now ready to expand our free-to-air channel offerings by an additional five channels from two channels currently, once the implementing rules and regulations are released,â€ he added.


ABS-CBN is spending P4 billion for its capital expenditures this year for the ongoing shift to the Japanese standard digital terrestrial television, for the regular capital expenditures of ABS-CBN, for its pay TV business through SkyCable, and for program rights.

It recently raised P6 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate bonds due 2021.

NTC commissioner Gamaliel Cordoba earlier said the guidelines for the adoption of the Japanese standard is expected to be completed either late the first quarter or early second quarter of the year.

Cordoba said NTC together with government agencies including the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) as well as the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) are finalizing the guidelines in consultation with various industry stakeholders.

Digital television is an innovative transmitting technology transforming television-viewing experience through better picture and sound quality.

According to Lopez, the government would make sure that Filipino households would be able to receive the digital signal either by shifting to TV sets cable of receiving the digital signal or buying set top box for their analog TV sets to receive the digital signal.

Upon the completion of the IRR, broadcast companies would start the simultaneous broadcasting for both digital and analog signal and would give enough time for Filipino households to buy digital TV or set top box for their analog units.

If all the households are now capable of receiving digital signals in their TV sets, he pointed out that the government would implement the â€œanalog shut offâ€ wherein broadcasting companies would stop transmitting analog signals.

Last November, NTC issued the memorandum circular for â€œStandard for Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) Broadcast Serviceâ€ as President Aquino announced the shift to digital TV using the Japanese standard after reaching an agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the Asean Meeting in Brunei in October."
Technology does not make us smarter,2013,"At the turn of the millennium, Stanford University professor emeritus Larry Cuban studied computer use in several preschools and kindergartens, high schools and universities in Silicon Valley. He concluded that generally, computers were “oversold and underused,” with few lasting benefits.

More than a decade later, Cuban had not changed his mind. So far, “cumulative evidence” regarding the effectiveness of digital devices in learning was “missing in action.”

“Occasional studies that do show promising results for new technologies are dragged in to cover the near nakedness of research, much like a fig leaf, to justify the high costs of these new devices in the face of little evidence,” said Cuban in his blog in March 2012.

“The fact remains that no one knows for sure whether the new hardware and software appearing in schools work,” he continued. “They are all beta versions, with glitches that teachers and students end up discovering.”

In 2000, policy expert Kirk Johnson of The Heritage Foundation studied data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress of fourth and eighth graders who used computers in class at least once a week and compared their performance to students who used computers less than once a week.


He found that students who used computers more often did not do better than those who did not.

“The use of computers in the classroom may not play a significant role in explaining reading ability,” Johnson said. “Thus, dedicating large amounts of federal tax dollars to the purchase of computer hardware, software and teacher training could crowd out other worthwhile education expenditures on, for example, new textbooks, music programs, vocational education and the arts.

“[I do] not suggest that there is no place for computers in the classroom … [But] computers may not have the effect on academic achievement in reading that some might expect, even when they are used by well-trained instructors.”

In 2006, University of Chicago economists Austan Goolsbee and Jonathan Guryan studied how successful E-Rate was in providing Internet access to public schools. E-Rate, a federal program, subsidizes public schools for computers and the Internet.

The economists focused on California, where, because of

E-Rate, the percentage of schools with Internet access grew from 55 to 85 percent in two to three years.

The researchers measured student scores in the Stanford Achievement Test in six subjects: mathematics, science, reading, language, spelling and social studies.

They found that the huge investment in computers had no effect on student performance in any of the six subjects after a year. After two years, student performance even went down!

The economists concluded in the journal Education Next that while E-Rate helped almost

every school in the country get hooked up to the Internet, “the Internet itself, though, seems unlikely to be a silver bullet for solving the problems of America’s public schools.”

No more laptops

In May 2007, The New York Times ran the front-page story, “Seeing No Progress, Some Schools Drop Laptops.”

It was found that students in Liverpool Central School District outside Syracuse, New York, used laptops to cheat on tests, surf porn sites and hack into businesses. Technical glitches occurred regularly, maintenance costs increased and the net often froze when many students logged on, not exactly for educational purposes.

And “after seven years, there was no evidence it had any

impact on student achievement—none,” Mark Lawson, Liverpool High School board president, told the Times. 

“The teachers were telling us, when there’s a one-to-one relationship between the student and the laptop, the box gets in the way,” he said. “It’s a distraction to the educational process.”

Especially in math. Instead of laptops, teachers preferred to use graphing calculators, having found the latter much more useful. Of course, nothing beats plain pencil and paper.

In subjects such as history, laptops were more helpful. Students used them to do research but their teacher, Tom McCarthy, reminded them not to overlook books, newspapers and academic journals.

“The art of thinking is being lost,” McCarthy told the Times, “because people can type in a word, find a source and think that’s the be all end all.”

Quick fix

The Texas Center for Educational Research examined state test scores between schools where students received laptops and those where students did not, and got mixed results.

When six of the schools in the study were offered laptops in 2007, they declined.

“Such disappointments are the latest example of how technology is often embraced by philanthropists and political leaders as a quick fix, only to leave teachers flummoxed about how best to integrate the new gadgets into curriculums,” said The New York Times.

Several schools in the United States are giving up or giving back their laptops. Matoaca High School in Virginia phased out laptops after concluding that students did not make any academic gains years after using laptops.

Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts eliminated its entire laptop program after it found that more energy was spent on repairing them than on training teachers to teach with them. 

Everett A. Rea Elementary School in Costa Mesa, California, gave away 30 new laptops to another school after new teachers did not do much with the technology.

U-turn at dead ends,2013,"I’m now 72  and just heard about these trees,” e-mailed former Evening News reporter Melody Santos-Drexler from San Francisco. “Some jerks cashed in (on) imports of exotic species,” Leonor Lagsca of Iloilo wrote. “Gmelina from India or Malaysia’s candlenut tree shoved our native trees into the cellar.”

There’s hope in a “bumper crop of local trees research,” notes Dr. Jurgenne Primavera. “Awareness of native flora has gained critical mass, sweeping in the industry sector. But where is the supply?”

Tongue-in-cheek, Primavera describes herself as “zoologist by training, aquaculturist by profession, tree lover and planter since the 1970s.” Time magazine, in 2008, named her among “100 Heroes of the Environment.”

The Ramon Aboitiz Foundation Inc. (Rafi) meanwhile has published “Native Trees in the Visayas.” This book vets scientific data on 101 native trees and rendered them in layman’s lingo. It displays the “white lauan” in Negros Occidental and the four-meter-tall   kaningag   of  Cebu.   Cinnamomum cebuense kost grows only in forest fragments of Tabunan and Cantipla in Cebu.

“Effects (of exotic tree imports) have been heartbreaking,” is Rafi’s candid introduction. “Now, we promote planting of endemic tree species… (Follow up) ensures survival of planted trees.” Today, eight out of 10 trees in Rafi projects do not fall by the wayside.

Providence gifted this country with almost 3,500 tree species. But is imported  sikat? Touted as fast growing, nine foreign exotics dominated government replanting  programs for decades. But they lacked the resiliency of the native trees after typhoons or droughts.


Iloilo’s River Esplanade is lined with Royal Palm trees—a monoculture of  roystonea  elata  hustled from Cuba. On the other end is Cebu’s 296-hectare South Road Properties. Ten years after opening, SRP remains a treeless semi-desert as sea levels rise.

In between are clones, notes Imelda P. Sarmiento, who edited “Philippine Native Trees 101”: In Forbes Park, Ayala Avenue, Ortigas or roadsides, the selection is cramped between foxtails and date palms to “the alien  podocarpus  and golden showers—yellow blooms for Aquino.”

The book musters 137 personal stories to illustrate 108 native trees. They include the critically endangered “Starburst” to “the Landscaping World’s Toast”—lubi-lubi  or  niyog-niyogan. This “is a start… toward reintroducing our own trees to our own people.”

Since 2004, Mindoro pine (pinus  merkusii) caromed into International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “Red List” of endangered trees. Calapan City Councilor Girlie Ignacio campaigned to roll back “hometown” threats to Mindoro’s own.  Jesuit scientist Peter Walpole has shown it grows in Zambales, and in Indonesia too. “We will popularize this tree in our urban areas,” Ignacio says.

“Shades of Majesty” is an earlier 212-page book that zeroes in on 88 hometown species. After that came “Beach Forests and Mangrove Associates in the Philippines.” The latter received a Best Book Award from the National Academy of Science and Technology. Coauthored by Primavera and Rex Sadaba, it spotlights 140 species—from the familiar   talisay,  dita  and  ipil  to  tugas  which can grow up to 200 kilometers inland.

The “Washington Sycip Garden of Native Plants” tacks a living dimension on these studies. What was a parking lot at the University of the Philippines Diliman until 2012 has been converted into a park that showcases 101 native trees. It honors a soldier, scholar and multi-awarded founder of the country’s largest professional services firm.

A red brick path today meanders along “islands” of  trees with tags that provide data from scientific name to tree tales. This is education by showcasing. “The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education,” Albert Einstein once joked.

The critical need is for nurseries that churn out seedlings, Primavera says. That’d call for a dialogue among a “triad of sectors”—(a) scientists who know the trees, (b) suppliers and  nurseries to grow saplings, and (c) landscape designers, developers and architects who create the demand for trees in public and commercial places.

The agenda must crunch numbers. Landscapers require planting of hundreds of trees, yet of the same species. Why? Need we strap monoculture for our streetscapes and public spaces? Native trees can bridge variety gaps.

There’s the issue of sizes. Landscapers require: “B and B”: up to 15-meter-tall trees ready to be “bagged and burlapped.” Start instead with one-and-a-half-meter saplings. This is a challenge for local governments, too. They get P68 billion in this year’s budget. Invest in trees, not waiting sheds, basketball courts or worse, self-granted allowances.

Landscape designers must convince gardeners and suppliers that there’s a market for native trees. Nothing works better than a buyer with cash.

“Does it make a difference whether we plant foreign mahogany from Bolivia rather than molave from the Philippines?” asks UP professor of plant diversity James LaFrankie. “Yes, and the reason, in one word, is ecology.”

Native species bear a relationship to land, water and organisms that developed over millennia. “No such relationship exists for the alien newcomer. Ten hectares of mahogany is a ‘dead zone’ in terms of biodiversity”: no birds, no insects, no seedling flourish beneath the canopy. “There is no future for 10 hectares of mahogany. It will remain as it is, until cut and replaced.”

“The alternative is… to rebuild forests with native species. Such schemes have been practiced for years by many Southeast Asian communities… The result for our children will be forests that grow.” We need to “U-turn” at a dead end.

IBM to train teachers in analytics,2013,"Technology solutions company, IBM, in its quest to have more Filipino “data scientists” is preparing to train teachers in Central Visayas in Analytics courses.

IBM officials have already trained 111 teachers from 32 schools in Metro Manila for the Analytics Courses to be offered in Business and Information Technology students starting this school year.

“We are coordinating with Ched (Commission on Higher Education) for the trainings and, of course, after we have started in Manila we’d like to come down to Cebu where we saw a huge potential for analytics,” said Jay Sabido, IBM R&D head, during the sidelines of the of the ICT/BPO Conference in Radisson Blu Hotel yesterday .

The Philippines is the first country to recognize “data scientists” as a profession that will help make the country more competitive and ready to tap the burst in demand for analytics come 2015, said IBM chief technologist Lope Doromal at the conference.

Doromal said analytics is the next big thing in the outsourcing industry adding that by 2015 about 4.4 million jobs will be created related to analytics and a $160 billion market around the world.

200,000 jobs


Analytics will allow industries and individuals to use available to data to make intelligent, insightful, and impactful decisions to grow their businesses.

“About 200,000 jobs in the United States (of America) by then will require IT skills in analytics,” Doromal said.

In May this year, Ched released a memorandum circular informing academic institutions that elective courses for Analytics will soon be offered as an option for those taking up courses in Business and IT.

The elective courses were designed in partnership IBM.

“Business Analytics for Information Technology Education (ITE) and the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) programs are ready for implementation this school year 2013-2014,” Doromal said.

He said that Business Analytics Specialization Tracks would use an integrated approach and would take into consideration the interrelationships among functional areas of business as well as sensitivity to the economic, social, technological, legal and international environment in which business must operate.

objective

“The objective of the program is not simply to impact basic business knowledge, but to instill and nurture import qualities and skills to the students that are essential for future business leadership and organizational success,” he said.

“These newly-approved specialization tracks on business analytics for ITE and BSBA programs bring us a step closer to preparing our nation to capture and lead in this big global analytics market,” said CHED chairperson Dr. Patricia B. Licuanan in a statement.

schools

Among the first institutions that will offer the course are the University of the Philippines – Diliman, Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, Asia Pacific College, University of Santo Tomas, College of St. Benilde, Universidad de Manila, Jose Rizal University, Technological Institute of the Philippines, Batangas State University, Republic Central Colleges and Araullo University of the PHINMA Education Network.

“In Cebu we are looking at training our partners like University of Cebu, University of San Jose Recoletos, Cebu Institute of Technology and Silliman State University in Dumaguete City,” Sabido said.

Do you have what I.T. takes?,2011,"In the late 1990s, the Philippines experienced its first Information Technology (IT) boom, with dozens of schools sprouting almost overnight to offer courses in computer programming and computer applications.  Young people were actively encouraged to take up IT with the promise of high-paying jobs waiting for them in the emerging technology sector.

Unfortunately, as it turned out, the emerging technology sector wasn’t quite there yet, and the bubble burst a few years later, with enrollment in some schools dropping by as much as 50 percent.

But the march of technology is inexorable.  Today, the advent of “cloud computing” and 4th-generation wireless networking has brought us to the next level of computing, with Information Technology permeating and transforming more and more aspects of our daily lives.

Although the Philippines still lags behind other Southeast Asian countries in terms of PC penetration, that only means that the potential for growth is greater.

The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector is expanding beyond voice services, and an increased global demand for trained IT professionals is fueling a resurgence in Information Technology education.  This time, the jobs are really there, not just locally, but internationally, for IT graduates with the right skills.

One of the most challenging aspects of IT education is staying on top of trends.  Information technology advances at such a rapid rate that business models could change several times in the four years it takes a computer science major to graduate.   Flexibility and adaptability have become key skills for today’s IT professional.

Many local schools are rising to the challenge. One of these is the Mapua Institute of Technology.

Best known for its engineering and architecture courses, the 85-year-old school went into information technology in a big way when it was acquired by the Yuchengco Group of Companies – a diverse business conglomerate whose members include the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation and the Malayan Insurance Company, among others – in 1999.  It has since opened the Mapua School of Information Technology in a new Makati campus, through which it offers B.S. degrees in Computer Science, Information Technology and Information Management.

“Information technology education suffered for a time when the IT bubble burst in the early 2000s,” says Dr. Rey Vea, president and CEO of Mapua.  “But the schools have recovered since, because IT is really here to stay.  You can’t conceivably run an organization today without IT.  We are now able to track every keystroke, every bit of data that goes into an organization.  The volume of data has increased tremendously.  The changes that have happened are mostly in the content.”

Computing is really entering the next level, he says, with the advent of “cloud computing” and new areas of application, such as mobile networking and business analytics.

“Education just follows those trends,” he says.  “And maybe, in a certain sense, leads the trends in business.  We are connected to cyberspace, to industry, and to other schools, so we have our ear to the ground all the time.”

The traditional notion of an academe that exists in an ivory tower, far removed from mundane concerns, won’t work for IT schools, he says.

“We have adopted what we call an outcomes-based philosophy of education,” he explains.  “We define a set of learning outcomes that we desire for our graduates, and these outcomes must be relevant to the industry.  That’s why we have academic advisory panels to help us define the knowledge, skills, understanding and values that our graduates should have in order to succeed in their fields.”

One way of keeping the school’s ear to the ground is through tie-ups with leading edge IT companies, which allow the school to offer “tracks” for students in specific technologies.

“One of the bigger names in cloud computing, NetSuite, is located here in Makati, and they are doing a lot of work with Filipino software engineers,” says Vea.  “We have signed up with them to offer a track in cloud computing using NetSuite technology.  We have allocated 12 units of electives for cloud computing.”

“With the explosion of data, the other concern is security,” he adds.  “That’s what most companies have on their minds when they go into cloud computing.  Mapua has been appointed by Cisco Systems to be the provider for its security module for the whole of South Asia.  We go to other countries such as Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia to train network professionals in the Cisco security module.”

The massive volume of data has also opened up another growth area of information management that has to do with analyzing this data in order to help business processes.

“It used to be called business intelligence, but more and more it is now being called business analytics,” says Vea.  “We are currently in negotiations with one company to be our partner in business analytics, so we will be offering another 12 units for our track in business analytics.”

Mapua’s fastest-growing course, however, is what it calls media arts and sciences, the wedding of the creative arts, communication and technology that sees applications in web design, computer graphics, video game design, and computer animation.

“The demand for people with multimedia arts and science skills is great, but there aren’t that many graduates, so the compensation for these guys is driven up because of the demand,” says Vea.  “But the economic angle is not enough to explain the phenomenon.  What drives enrollment is really the interest of young people who are both artistically and technologically inclined.  Most of them are attracted to it because it is the wave of the present and the future.  There are scrappy, small local companies that are starting up and trying to make it on their own.  Young people are coming together to do projects such as animation, web design, indie movies with a lot of CGI.  It’s a dynamic part of the economy.”

Obsolescence is a given in the IT industry. The pace of technological change is so fast that several trends might have come and gone within the four years that it takes for a student to finish his or her course.    The key, says Vea, is to ensure that IT students are grounded in the fundamentals before they go on to specialize, so they can stay current with the state of the art.

“What I want to see in the next five years is the Philippines being able to harness the human resources that it produces in order to be a leader in IT and IT-related businesses,” he says.  “With all the talents and resources that we have, there’s a chance that we can take the lead in business process outsourcing – not just voice but IT-enabled business processes such as engineering functions which can be outsourced and which we can do right here in the country.  There are definite moves in that direction and I see the Philippines getting stronger in the non-voice portion of BPO, and going further out into higher and higher value activities and services.  We have to train our people to be able to reach that level.”

SCIENCE COMMUNITY FETES PGMA IN “ALAY PASASALAMAT”,2010,"To give a fitting recognition to the steadfast support of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the science and technology sector, the Philippine scientific community held“Alay Pasasalamat” 25 June 2010 at the Heroes Hall, Malacañan.

The “Alay Pasasalamat,” organized by the National Academy of Science and Technology, is a tribute to the President by the Filipino scientists, science scholars, members of the science community and the academe, technology adoptors, and officials and staff of the Department of Science and Technology. Highlights of the event include an audio-visual presentation on the accomplishments of the science community that stemmed from the support of the President during her nine-year tenure, and testimonials from beneficiaries."
Philippine Technology Transfer Act of 2009 (Republic No. 10055).,2009,"The State fully recognizes that science, technology and innovation are essential for national development and progress. It shall, therefore, give priority to research and development, invention, innovation and their utilization. It shall also encourage the widest and most systematic participation of all stakeholders in policy-making related to science and technology, and in the generation, transfer and utilization of intellectual property, especially for the benefit of the general public. This Act aims to promote and facilitate the transfer, dissemination, and effective use, management, and commercialization of intellectual property, technology and knowledge resulting from Research and Development Institutions (RDIs) funded by the government for the benefit of national economy and taxpayers. The provisions of this Act shall apply to intellectual property created under existing laws, including, among others, Republic Act No. 9168 and the Philippine Plant Variety Protection Act of 2002.


The ownership of Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights (IPs and IPRs) shall be governed by the following: a) In recognition of the fact that RDIs are in a better position to identify the potential for economic utilization of IPs and IPRs subject to their possession of the right skills and management capability, the ownership of IPs and IPRs derived and generated from research funded by the Government Funding Agency (GFA), whether such funding is in whole or in part, shall, in general, be vested in the RDI that actually performed the research, except in specific circumstances."
PHILIPPINES: Scientists nurture young ‘Einsteins’,2008,"Scientists and technologists are among the main drivers of a country’s economic development, comments the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Vibrant economies usually have a high scientist-to-population ratio. In 2002, Singapore had 4,613 scientists and engineers engaged in research and development per million population, Malaysia had 726 and Vietnam 516. Indonesia had 445 the previous year. In contrast, the Philippines was at the bottom with only 108 scientists and engineers engaged in R&D per million population, according to 2003 Department of Science and Technology data.

The low ratio may be changing soon. A number of Filipino scientists and technocrats have been jetting to and from the Philippines, helping develop a critical mass of young scientists in the country. The scientists teach, lecture, form collaborations, lend expertise, and sometimes give young scientists the experience to work in laboratories abroad."
